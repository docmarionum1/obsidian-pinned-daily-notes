# Pinned Daily Notes for Obsidian

A plugin for Obsidian that helps you manage your daily notes with pinned tabs. It provides a dedicated button and command to open today's daily note in a pinned tab.

## Features

- Adds a ribbon icon (calendar+) to open today's daily note in a pinned tab
- Adds a command palette action "Open today's daily note" 
- When clicking the button or running the command:
  - If a pinned daily note tab exists: Updates it to today's note and focuses it
  - If no pinned daily note exists: Creates a new pinned tab with today's note
- Works with any daily note folder structure and format
- Respects your Daily Notes plugin settings

## How to Use

1. Install the plugin
2. Click the calendar+ icon in the ribbon (left sidebar) or use the command palette to run "Open today's daily note"
3. The first time you use it, a new pinned tab will be created
4. Move this tab wherever you want it to stay
5. From now on, that tab will be updated to show today's note whenever you use the plugin

## Configuration

- Note folder location
